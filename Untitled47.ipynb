        "        *   \"What's the typical number...?\" -> `GET_STATISTICS`\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Entity Extraction (Named Entity Recognition - NER):**\n",
        "    *   **Method:** Employ a sequence labeling model (e.g., Bi-LSTM-CRF, SpanBERT, or even rule-based regex for numerical values). This will identify and label key entities in the query.\n",
        "    *   **Entities to Extract:**\n",
        "        *   `FEATURE`: (e.g., 'median income', 'house value', 'housing age', 'rooms', 'bedrooms per room', 'population per household').\n",
        "        *   `VALUE`: (e.g., 'high', 'low', 'young', 'large', numerical values like '5.00', '3000', '0.2').\n",
        "        *   `OPERATOR`: (e.g., 'greater than', 'less than', 'between', 'around', 'equal to', 'typically', 'usually').\n",
        "        *   `QUANTIFIER`: (e.g., 'how many', 'list', 'show me', 'summarize').\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Relationship Extraction:**\n",
        "    *   **Method:** Use dependency parsing or rule-based patterns to understand how entities relate to each other and to the overall intent. For comparative queries, identify the two entities being compared and the comparison metric. For relationship queries, identify the two features for which a relationship is sought.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** In \"high income, young housing, and a large number of rooms,\" the NLP should identify `income=high`, `housing_age=young`, `rooms=large` as conjunctive conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Contextual Understanding (for Follow-up Questions):**\n",

        "*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** Users might ask questions directly referencing parts of the `description`.

        "*   **Example Generation:** When presenting examples, instead of just numerical values, the chatbot can include the full `description` for each example, offering a complete textual overview of the property.\n",

        "    *   **Range:** `('housing_median_age', 'between', 20, 40)` translates to `(df['housing_median_age'] >= 20) & (df['housing_median_age'] <= 40)`.\n",
        "    *   **Approximate:** `('median_income', 'around', 5.0)` translates to `(df['median_income'] >= 5.0 * 0.9) & (df['median_income'] <= 5.0 * 1.1)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Dynamic Query Assembly:** A Python function will take the extracted intent and a dictionary of extracted `FEATURE: (OPERATOR, VALUE)` pairs, and dynamically build the Pandas filtering and aggregation logic.\n",
        "    *   For example, if intent is `FIND_PROPERTY` and entities are `{'median_income': ('==', 'High'), 'housing_median_age': ('>', 30)}`, it would construct: `df[ (df['median_income_category'] == 'High') & (df['housing_median_age'] > 30) ]`."

        "### Evaluation of AI Chatbot Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "After executing the comprehensive set of 15 test queries, the chatbot's performance was evaluated across various dimensions:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Accuracy and Completeness of Responses:**\n",
        "*   **FIND_PROPERTY (Queries 1, 2, 3, 12, 15):** The chatbot successfully identified the `FIND_PROPERTY` intent, applied categorical and numerical filters correctly, and returned the requested number of examples or count. The `description` field was effectively used to provide rich, human-readable summaries for each example, enhancing completeness and naturalness.\n",
        "*   **GET_STATISTICS (Query 5, 13):** The chatbot accurately extracted the `GET_STATISTICS` intent and calculated statistics (mean, median, std, min, max) for the specified features within the filtered datasets. Response 13 demonstrates successful handling of multiple features and complex filters.\n",
        "*   **COMPARE_AREAS (Query 6, 14):** This intent showed a **weakness**. For Query 6 (\"Compare median house value between old homes and new homes.\"), the chatbot responded with \"Please specify comparison criteria and feature.\" This indicates that the NLP for extracting the comparison feature and the two groups was not sufficiently robust to handle this natural language phrasing. Similarly, Query 14 (\"Compare total rooms in areas with median income greater than 6 vs median income less than 2.\") also failed to extract the comparison feature and groups correctly. The hardcoded comparisons in `process_user_query` are too limited.\n",
        "*   **GET_RELATIONSHIP (Query 7):** This intent also showed a **weakness**. Query 7 (\"Is there a relationship between median income and housing median age?\") resulted in \"One or both features for relationship not found.\" The `process_user_query` function's regex for extracting features for `GET_RELATIONSHIP` (`relationship between (.+?) and (.+)`) did not correctly map \"median income\" and \"housing median age\" to their respective column names, indicating a need for better mapping or a more sophisticated NER approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Naturalness and Relevance:**\n",
        "*   For successfully processed queries (FIND_PROPERTY, GET_STATISTICS), the responses were generally natural and relevant, leveraging the `description` field effectively and formatting statistical output clearly.\n",
        "*   The generic relationship explanation for `GET_RELATIONSHIP` (if it were to trigger) is adequate for a simple chatbot but could be improved with actual correlation coefficients or visual insights in a more advanced system.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Error Handling:**\n",
        "*   **No Matching Records (Query 8, 9):** Query 8 (\"Find properties with high income and low income.\") incorrectly returned 5 examples. The `process_user_query` function applied the 'high income' filter, but the subsequent removal of the keyword prevented 'low income' from being processed as a conflicting filter. This is a critical error. Query 9 (\"List properties where total rooms are greater than 50000.\") also incorrectly returned 5 examples instead of \"No records found.\" This indicates that the numerical filter for total rooms > 50000 was not correctly applied or that the `user_query_lower.replace(keyword, '')` part for numerical filters is causing issues. The `apply_filters` function itself might be fine, but the parsing in `process_user_query` is flawed for some cases.\n",
        "*   **Ambiguous/Out-of-Scope Queries (Queries 4, 10, 11):** Queries 10 and 11 correctly identified as \"Unsupported intent\". However, Query 4 (\"What are the average median house value?\") was also marked as \"Unsupported intent\" despite containing keywords for `GET_STATISTICS`. This highlights a limitation in the intent recognition logic, as it expects more explicit phrasing like \"what is the average of...\" or \"what are the statistics for...\".\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Identified Areas for Refinement:**\n",
        "*   **NLP for Intent Recognition:** The current keyword-based intent recognition is brittle. For `GET_STATISTICS`, it needs to be more flexible (e.g., detecting \"average [feature]\" or \"mean [feature]\").\n",
        "*   **NLP for Entity Extraction (Numerical & Relationship Features):** The extraction of numerical features and the features for `GET_RELATIONSHIP` needs to be more robust. The current `replace(keyword, '')` approach might interfere with subsequent parsing. A more structured approach where all potential entities are extracted first, and then combined, might be better.\n",
        "*   **NLP for COMPARE_AREAS:** This intent requires significant improvement in parsing. It needs to accurately identify the comparison feature and the filters for two distinct groups from the query.\n",
        "*   **Filter Application Logic in `process_user_query`:** The order and method of applying categorical and numerical filters seem to have issues that lead to incorrect results (e.g., Query 8 returning results for conflicting filters) or not applying filters at all (e.g., Query 9 for total rooms > 50000). The keyword replacement might be the culprit. It's also possible `execute_query`'s `apply_filters` should return the `filtered_df` to `process_user_query` and then `process_user_query` should combine filters before passing to `execute_query`.\n",
        "*   **Handling of \"No Matching Records\":** The chatbot incorrectly returned examples for queries that should have yielded no results (Query 8, 9). This is a critical logical flaw that needs immediate attention.\n",
        "*   **Feature Mapping for `GET_RELATIONSHIP`:** The `col_map` in `process_user_query` needs to be expanded or a more dynamic mapping strategy is required to correctly link natural language feature names to DataFrame column names.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "While the chatbot demonstrates a basic ability to process structured queries and generate informative responses for `FIND_PROPERTY` and some `GET_STATISTICS` queries, significant refinements are needed in its NLP interpretation (especially for `COMPARE_AREAS` and `GET_RELATIONSHIP`), entity extraction, and the overall filter application logic to handle complex and potentially conflicting user queries accurately. The current implementation is prone to misinterpretation and incorrect data retrieval in more nuanced scenarios."
